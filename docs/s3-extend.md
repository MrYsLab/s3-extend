## Installing The Python Extension Servers

Follow [these instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to create a virtual environment.

After activating the virtual environment, open a terminal window and type:


```angular2html
pip install s3-extend
```

If you are installing on a Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5, install the pigpio library by typing:

```angular2html
pip install pigpio
```

 It may take several minutes to download and install the necessary
Python packages to support all the extensions.
