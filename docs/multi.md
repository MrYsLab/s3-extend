## Controlling Or Monitoring One Board With Another

<img src="../images/multi-boards.png" >

As the screen-shot above shows, it is possible to run multiple OneGPIO
extensions at the same time and have the boards interact with each
other.

This Scratch script will control the LEDs connected to an ESP-8266 and
Raspberry Pi by monitoring the state of a switch on an Arduino.

This script was run in a browser on a PC in off-line mode, allowing the
Raspberry Pi to be controlled remotely.
