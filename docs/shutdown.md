To properly close the s3a, s3e, s3p, s3pup, s3r, s3rp, and s3rh launchers, go into the 
command
or terminal window and type Control-C. This will ensure that all of the
processes started by a launcher are killed correctly.

If you kill the command or terminal or window ***before*** pressing Control-C,
processes may be left in a running state, preventing you from restarting the launcher.
If you forget to use Control-C and cannot restart the extension with its associated launcher,
reboot your computer to kill the running processes.
