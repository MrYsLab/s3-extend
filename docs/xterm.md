# Installing xterm For Mac and Linux (including Raspberry Pi)

The OneGPIO Extension launchers open a terminal window for each Banyan
component launched. Because there is no standard terminal for Linux and
for consistency when using a Mac, xterm will be used and needs to be
installed.

## Windows Installation
 
The xterm package is not required for Windows so you may skip to the
next step.

## Mac Installation

For the Mac, install XQuartz as described
[here.](https://www.xquartz.org/)

## For Linux and Raspberry Pi

Open a terminal window and type the following:

```
sudo apt-get install xterm
```
