## Python 3.8 (or newer) Verification
 
The Scratch 3 OneGPIO extension servers utilize the latest advances in
the Python 3 asyncio library. Python 3.8 or later is required to run
the servers.

To check if you have Python 3.8 (or newer) installed, open a command window and
type:

```
python3 -V
```

For Windows, you may need to type:

```
python -V
```

The Python version is displayed in the command window.

## Installing The Latest Version of Python 3

Always install the newest stable release of Python 3.

### Windows Users

To install Python 3.8 (or newer), go to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python home page,</a>
and download the latest 3.8 (or later) distribution for your operating system.

If you have Python 2.7 installed, you do not need to remove it.

If there is a checkbox to add Python 3.8 to your path during the installation 
process, make sure it is checked.

and download and install the latest version of Python 3.

### Linux Users
If Python 3.8 is not included with your distribution, you may install it
and have it coexist with the supplied version using the
