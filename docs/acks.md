## A Simple Expression Of Thanks

This project would not have been possible without the help of Hiro Osaki
and Edson Sidnei Sobreira, and indirectly, Seiji Matsushita.

Hiro wrote an excellent article, ["How to Develop Your Own Block for
Scratch 3.0"](https://medium.com/@hiroyuki.osaki/how-to-develop-your-own-block-for-scratch-3-0-1b5892026421),
that demystified the
[Scratch 3 Extension Specification.](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/blob/develop/docs/extensions.md)
In addition, he unselfishly  provided some personal guidance.

Edson provided some early testing and guidance that resulted in
simplifying the user's interaction with the OneGPIO extensions. Also, he
pointed me to the work of
[Seiji Matsushita,](https://github.com/manaviva/scratch-vm/blob/develop/src/extensions/scratch3_micramming/index.js)
who implemented language translation. The translation code I implemented
is based on Seiji's work.

Edson curates the
[HackEduca](https://www.hackeduca.com.br/) Web site.
